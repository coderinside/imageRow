Latex package to scale images to fit a predefined width

This package is based on a concept by Steven B. Segletes, http://tex.stackexchange.com/a/126224/19326, which I improved a bit and wrapped in a package.
Without the help of the nice people this package would not be possible. I would like to explicitly thank Steven B. Segletes and David Carlisle for their patience and explanations.
